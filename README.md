# Shiny App for IEP Zooplankton Data

This is a *very beta* visualization of the [Zooplankton IEP data from CDFW](http://www.dfg.ca.gov/delta/projects.asp?ProjectID=ZOOPLANKTON). 
It's a work in progress so all omittances, errors, and associated ripples to the space-time continuum are my own.
Raw data can be obtained via the FTP site *(1972-2017_CBMatrix)* here: **ftp://ftp.wildlife.ca.gov/IEP_Zooplankton/1972-2017CBMatrix.xlsx**

## The App 
It shows the range of available data for each station, and a graphical display of the abundances (boxplots) 
based on different groups/taxa. The map is interactively linked to the data, so changing values in the drop down box will re-focus the map,
and vice-versa.
